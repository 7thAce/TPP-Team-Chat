Twitch Plays Pokemon - PBR Team Chat
Created by 7thAce

This is a program that splits TPP chat into the teams that they bet on, allowing for easier strategizing as well as move % movement in real time.

Future plans: Chat colors, better differentianting of top betters, good stuff like that.

See the screenshots that will be here eventually.
